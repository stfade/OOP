Parametre ve argüman terimleri genellikle birbirinin yerine kullanılsa da, teknik olarak farklı anlamlara gelirler:

1. **Parametre (Parameter)**: Bir fonksiyonun tanımında belirtilen değişkenlerdir. Fonksiyonun nasıl çalışacağını belirlerler. Örneğin, [`divide`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fuser0%2Fschool%2FS2%2Fsemester1%2Foop%2Fmain.cpp%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%22ad04a5d7-a1dd-47c2-ad1a-dbc064ef9ef7%22%5D "Go to definition") fonksiyonundaki [`int a`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fuser0%2Fschool%2FS2%2Fsemester1%2Foop%2Fmain.cpp%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%2C%22ad04a5d7-a1dd-47c2-ad1a-dbc064ef9ef7%22%5D "Go to definition") ve [`int b`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fuser0%2Fschool%2FS2%2Fsemester1%2Foop%2Fmain.cpp%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22ad04a5d7-a1dd-47c2-ad1a-dbc064ef9ef7%22%5D "Go to definition") parametrelerdir.

2. **Argüman (Argument)**: Bir fonksiyon çağrıldığında bu parametrelere geçirilen gerçek değerlerdir. Örneğin, [`main`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fuser0%2Fschool%2FS2%2Fsemester1%2Foop%2Fmain.cpp%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%22ad04a5d7-a1dd-47c2-ad1a-dbc064ef9ef7%22%5D "Go to definition") fonksiyonunda [`divide(10, 0)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fuser0%2Fschool%2FS2%2Fsemester1%2Foop%2Fmain.cpp%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%22ad04a5d7-a1dd-47c2-ad1a-dbc064ef9ef7%22%5D "Go to definition") çağrısında [`10`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fuser0%2Fschool%2FS2%2Fsemester1%2Foop%2Fmain.cpp%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%22ad04a5d7-a1dd-47c2-ad1a-dbc064ef9ef7%22%5D "Go to definition") ve [`0`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fuser0%2Fschool%2FS2%2Fsemester1%2Foop%2Fmain.cpp%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%5D%2C%22ad04a5d7-a1dd-47c2-ad1a-dbc064ef9ef7%22%5D "Go to definition") argümanlardır.

Örnek üzerinden açıklayalım:

```cpp
int divide(int a, int b) { // a ve b parametrelerdir
    if (b == 0) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Division by zero is not allowed");
    }
    return a / b;
}

int main() {
    try {
        int result = divide(10, 0); // 10 ve 0 argümanlardır
        std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::invalid_argument &e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
